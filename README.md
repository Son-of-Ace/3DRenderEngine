# 3DRenderEngine
A 3D Rendering Engine made in OpenGL

------------------------------------------------ REQUIREMENTS -------------------------------------------------
1. You need to have VisualStudio installed to run this program.

---------------------------------------------------- GUIDE ----------------------------------------------------

To run the program, you will need to do these few things:
1. Install the repository as a .zip and unpack it somewhere.
2. Run the .sln file with VisualStudio.
3. Once the .sln file is open, in the top left you need to make sure that it is set to "Release" and "x64". Or else the includes wont be found.

---------------------------------------------------- EXTRA ----------------------------------------------------

1. Once your ran the program either through a built EXE or VisualStudio, you can hit the import model button and import any .obj file. I made a "TestModels" folder with a couple of models to get going.
2. Just note that it will create a .json within the folder that a .obj file was loaded from to cache the mesh and speed up rendering next times.
